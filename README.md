Node-RED node to get information and send commands to Huawei LTE routers.


Uses the unofficial API from npm package [huawei-lte-api](https://www.npmjs.com/package/huawei-lte-api).


Currently working methods of nodes are:
 - Get list if clients on the lan
 - Get list of known clients. Both earlier and currently connected clients
